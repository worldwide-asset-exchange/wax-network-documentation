# WAX Mainnet information

## WAX software

WAX blockchain requires a modified version of EOSIO `nodeos` daemon. 

The [official repository](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain) contains 
the actual version that is run by block producers (called Guilds in WAX terminology).

[Community contribution repository](https://github.com/cc32d9/wax2.0) contains the a merge of WAX 
software with latest EOSIO software. Most guilds are using this version for API and other 
non-producing nodes.

EOS Sweden maintains a public [repository of debian packages](https://waxsweden.org/apt-get-wax/)  
for WAX software.
