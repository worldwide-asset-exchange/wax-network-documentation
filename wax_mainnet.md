# WAX Mainnet information

## WAX software

WAX blockchain requires a modified version of EOSIO `nodeos` daemon.

The [official
repository](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain)
contains the actual version that is run by block producers (called
Guilds in WAX terminology).

[Community contribution repository](https://github.com/cc32d9/wax2.0)
contains the a merge of WAX software with latest EOSIO software. Most
guilds are using this version for API and other non-producing nodes.

EOS Sweden maintains a public [repository of Ubuntu
packages](https://waxsweden.org/apt-get-wax/) for WAX software.
